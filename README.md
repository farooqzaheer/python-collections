# python-collections
this repo is made for adavnce programming assignment in python there defined all collections of python programming language

instruction: in the cooection.py file all code commented if you wanto run, you have to uncommit each example.


Python has four collection data types - list, tuple, sets , dictionary
but python also comes with a specialized data structures.

1- list: A list is declared in square brackets, it is mutable, stores duplicate values.
2- tuple: A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.
3- sets: A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. In Python sets are written with curly brackets.
4- dictionary: A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values

specialized data structures
 1.namedtuple()
 2.deque
 3.chainmap
 4.counter
 5.orderedDict
 6.defaultdict
 7.userdict
 8.userlist
 9.userString
 
namedtuple: it returns a tuple with a neamed entry, which means there will lbe name assigned to each value in the tuple.
 
 
deque: it perform insertion and deletion easily
 
	 
ChainMap: it is a dictinary like class which is able to make a single view of multiple mappings.

	
Counter: it is a dictionary subclass which is used to count hashable objects.


OrderedDict: it is a dictionary subclass which remembers the order in which the entries were added.
